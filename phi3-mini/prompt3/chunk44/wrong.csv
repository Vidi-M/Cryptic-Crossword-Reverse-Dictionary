instead, customers bring their own reusable containers from home if desired (or better yet - compostable ones)', 'Some markets even have classes held regularly where participants can learn basic gardening skills such as composting, soil improvement techniques and companion planting (growing different crops together that help each other thrive).', 'For example some vendors may sell produce grown using organic or low chemical inputs, while others promote practices such as rainwater harvesting, recycling and composting which reduce the environmental impact associated with agricultural production', 'Small farms provide jobs for many people directly as well as indirectly through supporting local artisans who make things like soap, candles or clothing using farm-based materials such as wool from sheep raised on their land.', ""By providing an alternative source of produce that isn't reliant on large supermarkets which often prioritize packaged convenience over quality ingredients, farmers markets help shift our collective focus towards more sustainable lifestyles based around growing local food rather than buying imported goods shipped across continents."", ""The key is making sure that these events are accessible, affordable & diverse enough so that all members of society including low-income families who may be unable to participate otherwise due financial constraints or transportation issues can still benefit from them;
