meanings, etc.', 'Episodic memory: Memory for personal experiences, events, or situations in time.', 'Procedural memory: Knowledge of motor skills and actions, e.g., riding a bicycle, typing on a keyboard.', 'Priming: The subtle activation of particular memories or associations to stimuli (e.g., hearing ""Can you turn that off?"" might prime one\'s brain towards the concept of turning off something nearby).', 'Working Memory Model by Baddeley and Hitch: This model expands on the traditional STM model, proposing three main components:', 'Phonological loop (or articulatory rehearsal

manipulation and retention of images and spatial relationships.', 'Central executive: Acts as an attentional control center, integrating information from both memory stores and directing attention to relevant tasks or stimuli', 'Procedural Memory (a form of implicit memory): Involves the learning of motor skills, habits, and other automated behaviors through repetition and practice, which become

an exceptionally long period without any cognitive effort or rehearsal (commonly called photographic memory)', 'Memory Consolidation: The process of stabilizing a memory trace after it has been acquired, involving the strengthening and integration of new information into long-term memory storage through repeated practice or rehearsal (e.g., learning a musical instrument or mastering a language).', 'Encoding Specificity Principle: This principle suggests that memory retrieval is most effective when the cues present during recall match those present at encoding, meaning contextual factors and environmental conditions can influence how well we remember certain information.', 'Retrieval Cues: Stimuli or triggers that help access stored memories from long-term storage by activating associated neural networks in our brain (e.g., smell of a particular perfume might trigger a specific childhood memory).', 'Memory Decay Theory: A conceptual model suggesting that over time, unused information gradually fades away or becomes less accessible due to the weakening of synaptic connections between neurons involved in storing and retrieving this information (e.g., forgetting facts learned months ago without practice or review).', 'Reconstructive Memory: The notion that memories are not stored as exact replicas but rather reconstructed based on available cues, prior knowledge, beliefs, biases, and emotions during recall', 'Primacy Effect: The tendency for individuals to better remember items presented at the beginning of a list than those at its end, primarily attributed to increased attention and rehearsal during encoding (e.g., recalling first few names in a long phonebook).', 'Recency Effect: This effect describes the phenomenon where people tend to more easily recall items or information presented last in a sequence rather than earlier ones due to short-term retention, with minimal decay occurring during subsequent presentations (e.g., remembering recent events over those that occurred weeks ago).', ""Proactive Interference: A type of interference where previously learned material hinders or disrupts the learning and recall of new information by competing for retrieval resources in memory systems (e.g., difficulty remembering a phone number when it's similar to another recently memorized number).""]"
