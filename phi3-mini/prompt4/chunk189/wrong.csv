Limiters of horse's vision ,blinkers,"['Nostrils: horses primarily use their sense of smell through their nostrils for detecting scents, which may limit their visual perception in this regard.', 'Eyesight range: a horse has monocular vision with limited depth perception due to the placement of its eyes on the frontal part of its skull.', 'Blind spots: horses have two blind spots directly behind them and slightly off to the side, reducing their overall field of vision in these areas.', ""Visual acuity: a horse's visual acuity may be less sharp at certain distances or angles due to eye structure and focusing capabilities."", 'Field of view: horses have a wide field of view but not as expansive as humans, with their rear vision limited by the curve of their neck and head.', 'Color perception: while horses see colors well within the human visible spectrum, they may perceive some shades differently or less vibrantly than humans do.', ""Low light conditions: a horse's ability to navigate in low-light environments is reduced compared to daytime vision capabilities."", 'Motion detection: horses have good motion detection skills but their reaction time may not be as quick as that of prey animals with more acute reflexes.', ""Depth perception: due to the placement of a horse's eyes, they can struggle with accurately judging depth and distance in some situations."", 'Light sensitivity: horses have good vision during daylight but their night vision is limited compared to nocturnal animals like owls or cats.', ""Vision obstruction: physical barriers such as high-hanging objects, overhead obstructions, or dense foliage can limit a horse's visual range and field of view."", 'Age-related vision changes: just like humans, horses may experience age-related eye conditions that can affect their overall visual perception over time.', ""Vision impairments: injuries to the eyes or other related sensory issues could also impact a horse's vision capabilities."", 'Eye alignment disorders: misalignment of the eyes (strabismus) may hinder clear, cohesive visual perception for horses.', 'Refractive errors: while not common in animals, if a horse does develop refractive errors similar to humans, it could impact their vision clarity and sharpness.', ""Visual acuity decline with age: as horses age, their overall eyesight may deteriorate slightly due to natural aging processes within the eye's structure."", ""Prey animal instincts: despite having visual limitations like other prey animals, a horse's heightened sense of smell and hearing helps compensate for these deficits in detecting threats or navigating environments."", 'Vision adaptation: horses have evolved to adapt their vision capabilities based on the environment they inhabit; however, this does not change inherent visual limitations but rather how they use what they can see effectively.', ""Eye disorders and infections: diseases like uveitis or other eye-related conditions may affect a horse's vision depending on the severity of the issue."", ""Visual impairment due to environmental factors: certain environments with low light, excessive glare, or limited visibility can challenge a horse's overall visual capabilities.""]"
