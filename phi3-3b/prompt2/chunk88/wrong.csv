driver every month, and we want to make sure our rates reflect this reality,” says State Farm Vice President of Policy Development & Innovation Michael McLaughlin.', 'It helps customers who have a

to fewer accidents on the road and lower premiums for everyone', '“Telematics technology helps insurers identify these trends and take steps to encourage safer habits.”', 'It can help carriers differentiate themselves from competitors by offering innovative programs that appeal to customers’ desire for control over their premiums, according to State Farm', '“By better understanding our

competitors by demonstrating their value proposition, according to IINC', '“Telematics technology helps insurers provide value to customers by offering a program that rewards safe driving and provides transparency into how premiums are calculated.”', 'It allows carriers to identify trends such as age or driving behaviour — which can help them create more tailored policies for different segments of the marketplace, according to IINC', '“This enables them to develop policies that are more aligned with individual customers’ risk profiles, which ultimately helps improve customer satisfaction and retention.”', 'It can help insurers better manage claims by identifying high-risk drivers — according to Allstate CEO Tom Wilson', '“By identifying high-risk drivers early on, carriers can take steps
