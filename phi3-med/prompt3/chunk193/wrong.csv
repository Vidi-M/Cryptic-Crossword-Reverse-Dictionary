Instead of anagramming or reversal, it suggests that something about this clue is peculiarly appropriate.', 'The final answer could be ""MUMMIES,"" as mummies are indeed a resting place for Egyptian rulers (Pharaohs), and the use of \'oddly\' might imply an atypical perspective on what constitutes their resting place']"
