Attractive - I'm so new (anag),winsome,"['Evelyn Witts, my approach would be as follows:', '**Attraction**: Looking at the clue ""Attractive,"" we seek a word that could mean something or someone appealing to others on an aesthetic level but also fits into an anagram of ""I\'m so new."" A suitable fit here is ""Newswim"" (an imaginative creation since there isn\'t a direct, commonly used English word) where the rearrangement forms \'new,\' though it stretches the typical usage and context.', '**Energetic**: This fits as something showing or involving energy or enthusiasm which also anagrams ""I\'m so new."" A potential answer could be ""Newsome,"" a creative interpretation of someone with fresh, energet grooves in the English language lexicon.', '**Innovate - I**: Given that innovation involves introducing something new and this can also fit as an anagram for “I’m so new,” we might consider ""Newison"" (a creative adaptation), implying a person who brings in novelty, although it is not standard English terminology.']"
