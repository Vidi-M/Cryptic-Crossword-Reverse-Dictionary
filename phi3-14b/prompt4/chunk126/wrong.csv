(5 letters)', '""The moon shines on home land, but what lies in the currency?"" - The answer could be \'Change\' (an homophone with \'chang\', an old term for change or alteration), which fits as it represents something that can lie within currency and also maintains a cryptic nature suitable for crossword puzzles.', '""How does first and last again turn tide? The dragon called."" - This phrase points towards the concept of cyclical events, with \'dragon\' alluding to an element often associated with power or mythology', '""From Sigewif, sword fallen; what word bore first?"" - This phrase hints at something originating from conflict or battle (\'Sigewif\' can be interpreted as \'victory-woman\')', '""King\'s coin and the cold mourning?
