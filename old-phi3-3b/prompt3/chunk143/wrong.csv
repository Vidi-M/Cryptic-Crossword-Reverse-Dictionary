Effect - it slows down or stops objects and can convert kinetic energy into heat.', ""Action-Reaction Pairs (Newton's Third Law): When an object exerts a force on another, the effect is that the second object pushes back with an equal force in the opposite direction."", ""Thermal Expansion: Heating an object causes its particles to move more vigorously; Effect - this results in an increase in volume due to expansion of the material's structure."", 'Magnetic Force: The cause is magnetic fields interacting with each other or a magnetic material, leading to effects such as attraction or repulsion between objects and alignments of magnetic domains within materials.', ""Ohm's Law (Electricity): When voltage (cause) increases across a conductor while resistance remains constant, the effect is an increase in current flow through the conductor."", ""Lenz's Law: The cause is change in magnetic flux through a circuit; Effect - this induces an electromotive force and resulting current that opposes the change in flux (Law of Conservation of Energy)."", 'Doppler Effect: Cause - relative motion between source and observer, leading to the effect of apparent frequency shifts in waves like sound or light depending on whether the source is moving towards or away from the observer.', 'Law of Reflection (Optics): The cause is an incident ray striking a reflective surface; Effect is that the reflected ray emerges at equal angles but opposite to the angle formed by the incident ray and the normal line perpendinas to the surface.', ""Bernoulli's Principle: Cause - fluid flowing through a constricted area (like air moving over an airfoil); Effect - increased velocity of fluid results in decreased pressure, which can cause lift or suction effects crucial for flight and ventilation mechanisms."", 'Law of Universal Gravitation: The cause is the presence of masses; Effect is a gravitational pull between them proportional to their masses and inversely proportional to the square of the distance separating them.', ""Hooke's Law (Mechanics): Cause - force applied to an elastic material, like stretching or compressing springs; Effect is that the deformation experienced by the material is directly proportional to the applied force within the elastic limit."", ""Archimedes' Principle: The cause is an object immersed in a fluid, leading to effects including buoyant forces acting on the object and displacement of fluid equal to the volume of the submerged portion of the object."", ""Coriolis Effect (Earth Sciences): Cause - Earth's rotation; Effect is that moving objects appear to curve to the right in the Northern Hemisphere or to the left in the Southern Hemisphere, which has important implications for weather patterns and ocean currents."", 'Law of Conservation of Momentum: The cause is interaction between two bodies (e.g., collision); Effect - total momentum before interaction is equal to total momentum afterward when no external forces are involved, providing a basis for understanding motion in collisions and recoil phenomena.']"
