before this crisis began, there were serious challenges facing the NHS in terms of funding and workforce planning', 'It also asks whether there have been any unintended consequences for patient care and wider health and social care services.', 'We would like to thank them for their valuable contribution of evidence on this important topic.', 'In 2019 there were over 45,000 GP and nurse vacancies in the UK – almost double that recorded in 2018 - which was having an impact on patient access to services.', 'The workforce problem was made even worse by Brexit - with up to 50% of NHS staff from EU countries working within primary care having left since March 2016, according to recent analysis – along with a general lack of willingness among the UK population to fill these roles in sufficient numbers.', 'These trends were expected to continue, with the NHS facing increasing pressure in the coming years due to an ageing population.', ""The King's Fund report – released at the end of 2020 - highlighted that there had been an initial surge in demand for urgent NHS services during the first lockdown period (March to May), but as restrictions were lifted, it is thought that these numbers have fallen back a little"", ""The number of GP consultations in primary care is now reportedly back to around 70% (around half) of what it was before COVID-19, according to NHS Digital' CV registration data – but even these numbers may not be fully representative due to the impact that social distancing has had on routine appointments."", 'It is anticipated that these pressures may continue into 2021, as the number of people over the age of 65 continues to increase.', 'The NHS Confederation report states that there was a need for around an additional 2,000 full time equivalent posts to maintain this increased level of staffing.', 'The NHS Confederation report highlighted that there was a need for an extra 2,600 full time equivalent nurses in January 2021 alone to meet this increased workload – but that it is estimated by May of this year (when the number of admissions is likely to be at its highest) that more than 7,000 additional FTE staff will be required across England.', 'This includes patients from across all age groups and not just those who are particularly vulnerable.', 'It is likely that similar issues have persisted throughout 2021 due to the continued pressures faced by the NHS.', ""This information has been compiled through a range of official sources, including data released by NHS England/Improvement; The King's Fund; NHS Confederation; BMA GP survey results; and the Health Foundation."", 'These recommendations include improving workforce planning processes; better integration between primary care and social care systems; increased leadership from national government on priorities such as funding investment in NHS services – especially for those who need it most; and developing a long-term plan to reduce demand across all healthcare sectors.', 'Workforce levels have been impacted by several factors during recent years - including changes such as Brexit, rising vacancies across primary care (with GPs and nurses experiencing a 15% increase from January to August this year), and increased demand for services due to the ageing population.', 'This was highlighted in a 2019 report by the Health Foundation - which found that workforce planning had led to improvements of up to £68m across hospitals over two years through improved staffing levels (with an average annual saving of around £34,000 per hospital).', 'This is reflected in the evidence presented here - which highlights workforce shortages across primary care areas as well as hospitals', 'In addition to this - it may also be beneficial for trusts to look into adopting more flexible approaches to staffing models which could potentially improve productivity (such as by reducing reliance on agency and temporary workers).', 'In order to tackle this issue – it may be necessary for primary and social care systems to work more closely together in order to ensure that patients receive consistent care regardless of where they are seeking services from.', 'For example, research has shown that integrating health and social care can lead to significant improvements in quality (such as reducing hospital admissions by up to 30%), while also providing more effective support services outside of hospitinas.', ""These include issues with communication between different organisations; difficulties around sharing data; and lack of understanding about each other's roles within the healthcare ecosystem"", 'In addition, there should also be a focus on developing more effective governance structures that can help oversee these collaborative efforts – while ensuring that all parties involved have access to necessary resources (including human capital) as well as clear guidance on how they can work together towards common goals.', 'This issue has been exacerbated by recent events such as COVID-19 and Brexit, which have had a significant impact on workforce numbers and recruitment strategies within the sector (as highlighted in this submission).', 'This should include providing greater support around funding investment into NHS services – especially where there may be high levels of demand or areas that require urgent attention due to underfunding (such as mental healthcare).', 'For example, rural communities may struggle more than urban areas with regards to recruitment due to limited opportunities available for healthcare professionals – which could impact patient outcomes if left unaddressed over time.', 'This will allow stakeholders at all levels – including local authorities, healthcare providers and patients themselves - to have a better understanding about where funding needs are most urgently required so they can work together towards delivering high-quality care.', 'To address these issues effectively - there needs to be a concerted effort towards developing a long-term plan that focuses on reducing overall demand for healthcare services while also improving productivity within the system (including through better utilisation of resources).', 'For example, research has shown how social determinants like income inequality can impact overall health outcomes within communities – meaning there needs to be greater focus placed on addressing these issues if we want our NHS system truly resilient enough']"
