Support ,pedestal,"['Penelope Wordsmith, I would support the following interpretations of the crossword clues:', 'In this context, these words can be related to resources, items, information, etc., which are readily accessible when needed.', 'On tap - This phrase is often used figuratively to describe resources (such as water) available easily for immediate use', ""Abundant - When something is abundantly present, it means there's an ample amount of it which can be readily accessed"", 'Easily obtainable - The phrase itself directly addresses the ease at which something can be obtained, making it a perfect fit for this clue.', ""Accessible - Something is accessible when it's easily reached or available to use, aligning well with the given crossword clue."", 'Obtainable on demand - This term implies that an item or resource is readily obtainable whenever needed without any effort or waiting time', ""At-hand - When something is at hand, it's immediately available to one without having to search for it far away or make much effort to get it"", 'Handy - While often used in relation to tools and devices that are conveniently placed or easily utilized, this word can also imply accessibility, making it a potential answer choice for ""Readily Available.""', 'Quickly available - The term emphasizes speed along with availability; something is immediately accessible when needed, aligning well with the crossword clue theme.', 'Instantly obtainable - Similar to quickly available, this phrase highlights both immediacy and accessibility of getting or acquiring something without delay or effort.', 'Conveniently accessible - This term combines convenience (a sense that things work smoothly) with accessibility, which could fit the crossword clue\'s theme when interpreted more broadly as ""readily available.""', ""Within reach - When something is within one's reach, it means they can easily obtain or use it, fitting well into the concept of availability and immediate access."", 'Available at short notice - This phrase suggests that an item or resource can be accessed with minimal preparation time, making it suitable for a crossword clue focused on readily available resources.', ""Up-to-the-minute - When something is up to the minute, it's current and immediately accessible; this term works well in the context of availability."", ""Promptly available - This phrase emphasizes immediacy along with accessibility, fitting into the crossword clue's theme when considering readily available resources or information."", 'Quick-fetching - Refers to something that can be quickly obtained without much effort; it aligns well with the concept of immediate availability.', 'Straightforwardly obtainable - This phrase suggests an uncomplicated process in acquiring a resource, matching well with readily available themes.', ""Directly obtainable - When something is directly obtainable, it's easily accessible without any additional steps; this term suits the crossword clue theme of immediate accessibility or availability."", 'Instantaneously accessible - This phrase emphasizes a sense of immediacy and ease in getting to what one needs, fitting well into readily available themes.', 'Empty belly - While this phrase metapoeitally relates to hunger when referring to an empty stomach, it can also represent the state where there are no resources or food around, indirectly referencing unavailability rather than availability; however, if interpreted in a broader sense (e.g., lacking immediate access to food), it might fit thematically with ""Readily Available"" when considering solutions for addressing hunger.', 'Lean and gaunt - This phrase typically describes the physical state of someone who has been without proper nutrition, but in a broader sense, it could suggest that resources are scarce or unavailable; however, if reinterpreted to imply taking action against such states (e.g., ensuring readily available food for those affected), it might relate thematically with ""Readily Available.""', 'Here are potential answers:', 'Unfed - Refers to someone who has not eaten recently.', 'Undernourished - Describes a person whose diet is insufficient in nutrients, often leading to hunger.', 'Malnourished - Similar to undernourished; refers to an individual suffering from lack of proper nutrition and potential hunger due to deficiencies.', 'Starving - A state of extreme hunger where someone is desperately in need of food.', 'Famished - Feels extremely hungry, as if one might starve without immediate sustenance.', 'Hungry stomach - Describes a feeling experienced by an individual when their abdominal area feels empty and they are craving food.', 'Inadequately fed - Implies that someone is not receiving enough nutrition or food, leading to potential hunger.', 'Underfed - Indicates insufficient intake of food necessary for good health, which could result in persistent feelings of hunger.', 'Deprived of food - A condition where a person lacks access to adequate amounts of food over an extended period, leading to potential long-term effects like chronic hunger.', ""Nutrient deficiency - Refers to the lack of essential nutrients in one's diet, which can lead to various health issues including persistent hunger and malnutrition."", 'Fasting (when unintended) - The act of voluntarily abstaining from food; if done for prolonged periods without proper guidance or intention, it could result in an extreme state of hunger.', 'Empty belly - A metaphorical expression that vividly conveys the sensation of emptiness associated with a lack of food intake and hunger.', 'Goiter (indirectly related to left hungry) - Although primarily known as an enlargement of the thyroid gland, it can also symbolize malnutrition and deficiencies that could lead to feelings of persistent hunger if not addressed', ""Vitamin deficiency - A condition resulting from insufficient intake of essential vitamins; while it doesn't directly express hunger itself, long-term deficiencies can affect appetite and food consumption patterns."", ""Picky eater (can lead to hunger if not addressed) - Although a picky eater isn't inherently associated with hunger, persistent refusal to eat certain foods could potentially result in nutritional deficiencies and an underlying sense of hunger if the issue remains unresolved."", 'Food insecurity - A term describing lacking consistent access to enough food for a healthy life; it embodies systemic issues that may lead to hunger on a larger scale, rather than individual experiences.', 'Lean and gaunt - This phrase typically describes an extremely thin appearance resulting from severe undernutrition, which is often associated with long-term lack of food intake (hunger).', 'Gaunt - A state of being markedly thin due to chronic hunger or malnutrition; a descriptive term that reflects the physical condition of someone who has been without adequate nutrition for an extended period.', 'Starving mouth - An idiomatic expression referring directly to the sensation of having no food and feeling extremely hungry.', 'Hunger pangs - Sudden, involuntary contractions or cramps in the stomach area, often associated with the immediate physical symptoms experienced by someone who is very hungry.']"
