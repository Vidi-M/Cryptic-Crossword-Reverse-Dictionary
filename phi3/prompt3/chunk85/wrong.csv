for example, some languages have more words for colors than others and this affects their ability to distinguish shades within those categories.', 'Cross-linguistic influence can occur during bilingualism: Bilinguals often experience cross-linguistic transfer where knowledge from one language impacts performance in another; this phenomenon is evident when a speaker uses grammatinas or pronunciation patterns from their second language while speaking their native tongue.', 'Language may limit thought processes: The Sapir-Whorf hypothesis argues that language shapes cognition by constraining what thoughts can be expressed and therefore limits our ability to conceptualize certain ideas; however, recent research suggests this influence is weaker than originally believed.', 'Bilingualism affects brain structure: Some studies indicate bilinguals have larger cortical surface area compared to monolinguals due to the need for more neural connections in managing two languages simultaneously which can lead to increased gray matter density', 'Language learning affects brain development: Learning a new language during childhood has been found to enhance certain aspects of brain plasticity, including increased connectivity between different regions involved in processing spoken words or comprehending syntax structures;
